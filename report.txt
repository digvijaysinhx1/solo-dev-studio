Locking the colors **now** is smart. Once colors drift, the whole site loses control.
Below is a **final, complete color palette** for **Solo Dev Studio**, with **exact usage rules** so you don’t second-guess later.

No theory fluff. This is your source of truth.

---

# **Solo Dev Studio — Color Palette**

## 1. Core Background Colors

### Primary Background

**Charcoal Black**

```
#0B0B0C
```

Use for:

* Entire page background
* Hero section
* Navbar area
* Footer background

Rule: never replace this with pure black.

---

### Card / Surface Background

**Soft Graphite**

```
#141416
```

Use for:

* Service cards
* Pricing cards
* Contact form container
* Any elevated section

This creates depth without shadows.

---

## 2. Text Colors

### Primary Text

**Soft White**

```
#F1F1F1
```

Use for:

* Headings
* Main body text
* Important labels

Never use pure white (`#FFFFFF`). It’s too harsh.

---

### Secondary / Muted Text

**Muted Ash**

```
#9A9A9A
```

Use for:

* Descriptions
* Helper text
* Footer text
* Subtitles

This is what makes the site feel calm.

---

## 3. Border & Divider Color

### Subtle Border

```
rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)
```

Use for:

* Card outlines
* Input borders
* Section separators (if any)

No visible lines. Just suggestion.

---

## 4. Accent Color (Only One)

### Steel Indigo (Accent)

```
#6B7CFF
```

Use **sparingly** for:

* Primary CTA buttons
* Important links
* Highlighted pricing card border
* Active states (focus, hover)

Never use accent color for:

* Paragraph text
* Background fills of sections
* Decorative elements

If you feel tempted to add a second accent, don’t.

---

## 5. Button Color Rules

### Primary Button

* Background: `#6B7CFF`
* Text: `#0B0B0C`

### Secondary Button

* Background: transparent
* Border: `rgba(255,255,255,0.12)`
* Text: `#F1F1F1`

Hover:

* Slight brightness increase only
* No scale, no glow

---

## 6. Input Field Colors

* Background: transparent or `#141416`
* Border: `rgba(255,255,255,0.1)`
* Text: `#F1F1F1`
* Placeholder: `#9A9A9A`

Focus state:

* Border turns accent color
* No box shadow

---

## 7. Disabled / Low-Emphasis Elements

Use:

```
rgba(241, 241, 241, 0.4)
```

For:

* Disabled buttons
* Secondary labels
* Less important metadata

---

## 8. DO NOT USE (Strict)

Do **not** introduce:

* Gradients
* Neon colors
* Warm colors (orange, red, yellow)
* Pure black or pure white
* Glassmorphism blur

These will break the premium calm.

---

## 9. Visual Hierarchy Using Color

Hierarchy comes from:

1. Size
2. Spacing
3. Weight

**Not** color.

Color is a guide, not a shout.

---

## 10. One-Line Memory Rule

If you forget everything else, remember this:

> Dark charcoal base, soft white text, one calm blue accent, nothing more.

Stick to this palette and your site will stay clean, global, and professional.

---

If you want next:

* A Tailwind color config
* A Figma color style setup
* A contrast accessibility check

This palette is final and safe to build on.
